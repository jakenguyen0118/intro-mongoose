## Explain what is an ODM/ Intro to Mongoose

ODM stand for Object Document Model. It translates the documents in Mongo into upgraded JavaScript Objects that have more helpful methods and properties when used in conjunction with express.

Rather than use the Mongo shell to create, read, update and delete documents, we'll use an npm package called `mongoose`.

Let's review the [mongoose docs](https://mongoosejs.com/). 

Without actually having worked with `mongoose` yet let's see if we can put your discovery tools to the test.  See if you can answer the following questions based on the documentation:

- :question: What syntax  `connect` to the mongo database with a name of `tweets`?
- :question: What is the overall syntax for writing a `Schema` a schema?
- :question: What does `useNewUrlParser: true` do and why should we use it? 

<hr>

Mongoose will allow us to create schemas, do validations and make it easier to interact with Mongo inside an express app.


## Make a Schema

A schema will allow us to set specific keys in our objects. So if we have a key of `name`, we won't be able to insert other keys that don't match like `firstName` or `names`. This helps keep our data more organized and reduces the chance of errors.

We can also specify the datatypes. We can set the datatype of `name` to a `string`, `age` to a `number`, `dateOfBirth` to a Date, `bff` to a Boolean etc.

We can also make some fields required and we can set default values as well.

Here is a sample Schema, with many options. 
```js
const articleSchema = new Schema(
  {
    title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }, //can say whether we want properties to be required or unique
    author: { type: String, required: true },
    body: String,
    comments: [{ body: String, commentDate: Date }], // can have arrays of objects with specific properties
    publishDate: { type: Date, default: Date.now }, // can set defaults for properties
    hidden: Boolean,
    meta: {
      votes: Number,
      favs: Number
    }
  },
  { timestamps: true }
)
```

## Basic Set Up

In order to get coding `student_examples` should already be configured with the following:


| File | Purpose|
| ----------- | ------------- |
| controllers/tweet.js         | business logic to connect to DB for full CRUD          |
| db/connection.js       | sets up a connection to the db        |
| db/seed.js       | some seed data to get us started       |
| models/tweet.js      | schema structure for our data        |

## Set Up Mongoose

Inside `db/connection.js` we need to do the following:

- import `mongoose`
- define the URI to the mongo database (in our case `tweet`)
- open a connection to the `tweets` database
- export `mongoose`


Let's first import and export `mongoose`

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

// rest our code will go here

module.exports = mongoose;
```

Now let's define the connection URI to the database we want to use.


```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const mongoURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/' + 'tweets'

module.exports = mongoose;
```

Mongoose requires a few configuration parameters in order to work the way we need so let's add them.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const mongoURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/' + 'tweets'
const config = { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true };

module.exports = mongoose;
```

Almost there. Now we need to connect to mongo at the URI. 


```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const mongoURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/' + 'tweets'
const config = { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true };
mongoose.connect(mongoURI, config);

module.exports = mongoose;
```

If we run the file in node we will see that it's connected.

```sh
node connection.js
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZYz3FUF.png">

At this point our terminal has been hijacked by  `mongoose` and we would like to get it back by connecting to the `connection` and then `closing` it


```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const mongoURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/' + 'tweets'
const config = { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true };
mongoose.connect(mongoURI, config);

const db = mongoose.connection;
db.close()

module.exports = mongoose;
```



We can even provide error/connected/success messages about the connections. 

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const mongoURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/' + 'tweets'
const config = { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true };
mongoose.connect(mongoURI, config);

const db = mongoose.connection;

db.on('error', err => console.log(err.message + ' is mongod not running?'))
db.on('connected', () => console.log('mongo connected: ', mongoURI))
db.on('disconnected', () => console.log('mongo disconnected'))

db.close()

module.exports = mongoose;
```


## The Tweet Schema

In `models/tweet.js` we will need to import the connection to the db before we can create a schema.

```js
const mongoose = require('../db/connection');
```

Once the connection is established we can create a new instance of the `Schema`


```js
const mongoose = require('../db/connection');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema; 

const tweetSchema = new Schema(
  {
    title: String,
    body: String,
    author: String,
    likes: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    sponsored: { type: Boolean, default: false }
  },
  { timestamps: true }
)
```

And with the `Schema` in place we can create a `model`

```js
const mongoose = require('../db/connection');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema; 

const tweetSchema = new Schema(
  {
    title: String,
    body: String,
    author: String,
    likes: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    sponsored: { type: Boolean, default: false }
  },
  { timestamps: true }
)

const Tweet = mongoose.model('Tweet', tweetSchema)
module.exports = Tweet
```

## Create a Document with Mongoose

Since `controllers` are the gatekeepers to the data in the database we need to import the model there and use it to create a new `document`

First we need to import the connection.

```js
const mongoose = require('../db/connection');
```

Then the model

```js
const mongoose = require('../db/connection');
const Tweet = require("../models/tweet");
```

And finally we will need to terminal the connection so we need to create a connection. 

```js
const mongoose = require('../db/connection');
const Tweet = require("../models/tweet");
const db = mongoose.connection;
```

### Our First DB Entry
Before we import seed data let's create a single object that contains all the tweet info we need based on the `Scehma` we configured earlier. 


```js
const myFirstTweet = {
  title: 'Deep Thoughts',
  body: 'Friends, I have been navel-gazing',
  author: 'Karolin'
}
```

Using the `Tweet` model we can create the the `document` and then close the connection.

```js
Tweet.create(myFirstTweet, (error, tweet) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error)
  } else {
    console.log(tweet)
  }
  db.close();
})
```

Run the controller and let's see it in action

```js
node controllers/tweet.js
```


We should see:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qi4Y5zA.png" />

As we can see a unique `_id` has been assigned to the `document`.

Every time we run `node controllers/tweet.js` it will run the code, and thus insert this object over and over again. Let's not do that. Let's comment it out.

Let's insert many more tweets.  Inside of the `db` folder there is a file called `tweets.js` and includes the following list of tweets:

```js
const manyTweets = [
  {
    title: 'Deep Thoughts',
    body: 'Friends, I have been navel-gazing',
    author: 'Karolin'
  },
  {
    title: 'Sage Advice',
    body: 'Friends, I am vegan and so should you',
    author: 'Karolin',
    likes: 20
  },
  {
    title: 'Whole Reality',
    body:
      'I shall deny friendship to anyone who does not exclusively shop at Whole Foods',
    author: 'Karolin',
    likes: 40
  }
  //...more tweet below


  module.exports manyTweets
]
```

Let's first import the tweets

```js
const manyTweets = require('../db/tweets.js')
```

And then insert them all into the database:

```js
Tweet.insertMany(manyTweets, (error, tweets) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error)
  } else {
    console.log(tweets)
  }
  db.close()
})
```

Here is the final code. 

```js
const mongoose = require('../db/connection');
const Tweet = require('../models/tweet.js');
const db = mongoose.connection;

const manyTweets = require('../db/seed.js');

Tweet.insertMany(manyTweets, (error, tweets) => {
	if (error) {
		console.log(error);
	} else {
		console.log(tweets);
	}
	db.close();
});
```

Run `node controllers/tweet.js` to see the tweet creation process.

## Find Documents with Mongoose

- Mongoose has 4 methods for this
- `find` - generic
- `findById` - finds by ID - great for Show routes!
- `findOne` - limits the search to the first document found
- [`where`](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html) - allows you to build queries, we won't cover this today

 ### Find All

Let's `find` all documents

```js
Tweet.find((err, tweets) => {
  console.log(tweets)
  db.close()
})
```

Let's limit the fields returned, the second argument allows us to pass a string with the fields we are interested in returning

```js
Tweet.find({}, 'title body', (err, tweets) => {
  console.log(tweets)
  db.close()
})
```
### Find One
Let's look for a specific tweet:

```js
Tweet.find({ title: 'Water' }, (err, tweet) => {
  console.log(tweet)
  db.close()
})
```

### Advanced Queries

We can also use advanced query options. L

#### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="alarm_clock" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/23f0.png">‚è∞</g-emoji> Activity - 10min

Let's review the [mongoose docs](https://mongoosejs.com/). 

Now that you know a little more about creating `documents`, review the documents and if you can create a query for the following:

- return tweets with 20 or more likes
- return tweets with 20 or more likes where the `author` is `alex`

<hr>

<details><summary></summary>Solution</details>

<!-- ```js
Tweet.find({ likes: { $gte: 20 } }, (err, tweets) => {
  console.log(tweets)
  db.close()
})
``` -->

### Delete Documents with Mongoose

We have two copies of our first tweet and a few options to delete it. 

- `deleteOne()` this seems like a great choice
- `.findByIdAndDelete()`- finds by ID - great for delete routes in an express app!

```js
Tweet.deleteOne({ title: 'Deep Thoughts' }, (err, deleted) => {
  console.log(err)
  db.close()
})
```

Or...

```js
Tweet.findByIdAndDelete({ _id: id }, (err, deleted) => {
  console.log(err)
  db.close()
})
```

### Update Documents with Mongoose

Finally, we have a few options for updating

- `update()` - the most generic one
- `findOneAndUpdate()`- Let's us find one and update it
- `findByIdAndUpdate()` - Let's us find by ID and update - great for update/put routes in an express app!


```js
Tweet.findOneAndUpdate(
  { title: 'Vespa' },
  { sponsored: true },
  (err, tweet) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err)
    } else {
      console.log(tweet)
    }
    db.close()
  }
)
```

If we want to have our updated document returned to us in the callback, we have to set an option of `{new: true}` as the third argument

```js
Tweet.findOneAndUpdate(
  { title: 'Vespa' },
  { sponsored: true },
  { new: true },
  (err, tweet) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err)
    } else {
      console.log(tweet)
    }
    db.close()
  }
)
```

We'll see the console.logged tweet will have the value of sponsored updated to true. Without `{new: true}` we would get the original unaltered tweet back.

### Intermediate

We can count how many tweets we have with likes greater than 20

```js
Tweet.countDocuments({ likes: { $gte: 20 } }, (err, tweetCount) => {
  console.log('the number of tweets with more than 19 likes is', tweetCount)
  db.close()
})
```

### Advanced & New-ish!

Mongoose 5.0.0 came out on January 17, 2018
[It has an updated query builder that chains much like jQuery](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html).

Do a search, limit the number of returned queries to 2, sort them by title

```js
const query = Tweet.find({ likes: { $gte: 20 } }, 'title -_id')
    .limit(2)
    .sort('title');


query.exec((err, tweets) => {
    console.log(tweets)
    db.close()
})
```

In the above code, the query variable is of type Query. A Query enables you to build up a query using chaining syntax, rather than specifying a JSON object. The below 2 examples are equivalent.

`.exec` will allow you to execute the query. You could use this to save a query in a variable and execute it at a later time.
